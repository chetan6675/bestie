     <h5>Hey Hey Vanshika,<br>

        I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I want to share something with you. Over time, my feelings for you have grown beyond friendship. <br>
        You've always been my best friend, my confidant, and the one I can always count on. But somewhere along the way, I realized that what I feel for you goes deeper than that. <br>       
        I admire your strength, your kindness, and the way you make everything around you brighter. <br>
        I cherish the moments we’ve spent together, the laughter, the talks, and the little things that mean so much. <br>
        You make me feel complete, and it’s hard to imagine my life without you in it, not just as my best friend, but as something more. <br><br>
        
        I’m nervous to say this, because I never want to lose the incredible bond we have, but I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer. <br>
        I’ve fallen for you, and I can’t help but wonder if maybe you feel the same way. <br>
        Please don’t feel pressured to respond right away. <br> I value our friendship more than anything, and I hope this doesn’t change things between us, no matter what. <br>
        I just wanted to be honest about how I feel and to hear what’s in your heart. <br><br>
        
        Whatever your response, I’ll always be here for you. <br><br>
        
        With all my heart, <br>
        Chetan, <br><br>
