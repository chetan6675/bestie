    <h4>Vanshika <br> In a world that often feels chaotic, you are my constant, my anchor. <br> 
        Through every high and low, you've stood by my side, not just as a friend, but as a part of my heart. <br>
         You know me better than I sometimes know myself, and you always seem to find the right words when I am lost for them. <br>
          Laughter is brighter, and challenges seem lighter when you're around. <br>
        We've shared so many moments—some big, some small—but all of them have become memories I'll cherish forever. <br>
         You remind me that friendship is one of the greatest gifts, and <br> 
         I'm endlessly grateful to call you my best friend. <br>
          Here's to more adventures, inside jokes, late-night talks, and the unwavering support you give so effortlessly. <br>
          Thank you for being you.
